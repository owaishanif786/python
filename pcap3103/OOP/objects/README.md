# Objects in python

Everything in python is object. e.g

```python
my_str = 'this is string'
type(my_str)
dir(my_str) # this will show you all the entities or method/properties for that object

import sys
type(sys)
dir(sys)
```

also if you want to get description of that object/entity you can use __doc__ property. i.e
`my_str.__doc__`
