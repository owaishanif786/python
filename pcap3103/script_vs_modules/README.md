Normally if you import a module two times in differnt files then it will import the things as many times you import that thing in other files. but  run script lines only once like print statement.


__name__ variable tells us the context of file in which its running. 

The actively running script will have __name__ equals to "__main__"

double underscores is reffered as dunders

if you need to run moudle as main script then you can pass -m flag and filename

python -m helpers
